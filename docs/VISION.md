# Vision

Text you write becomes motion you see. Emotion Universe aims to turn raw text into a living emotional space: DOM gradients and micro-animations for immediate feedback, and a 3D emotional galaxy (R3F) with planets, satellites, orbits, and energy links.

## Objectives

- Real-time emotional analysis with a single unified pipeline (online/offline).
- Aesthetic, legible visuals at 60 FPS on mainstream devices (1080p target).
- Minimal friction for experimentation: Leva controls, fast reloads, clean architecture.

## Principles

- One canvas (R3F), composable effects, and a single source of truth for state.
- Strict data contract validation (Zod) with permissive fallbacks for robustness.
- UX that respects thinking/loading states and avoids distracting noise.
